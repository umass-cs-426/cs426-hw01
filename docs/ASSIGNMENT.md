## How to See Your Results
After you push any commit, tests run automatically in your fork.

1) Open your fork’s Actions page:
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/cs426-hw01/actions`
2) Click the latest workflow run to see test results and logs.

After you submit (push the `hw01-submit` tag), your anonymous result appears on the class leaderboard:
