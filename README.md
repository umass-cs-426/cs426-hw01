## Overview
This repository contains the starter code and visible tests for HW1.

## Learning Goals
- <Goal 1>
- <Goal 2>

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

## Tests
- Visible tests live in `tests/`.
- CI runs Jest + Supertest on every push.
- Passing CI means all visible tests pass.
- Tests are a baseline indicator, not the full grade.
- CI also publishes a summary artifact used for the anonymous leaderboard.

## How to See Your Results
After you push any commit, tests run automatically in your fork.

1) Open your fork’s Actions page:
   `https://github.com/<your-username>/cs426-hw01/actions`
2) Click the latest workflow run to see test results and logs.

After you submit (push the `hw01-submit` tag), your anonymous result appears on the class leaderboard:
- `https://umass-cs-426.github.io/cs426-hw01-leaderboard/`

## Hidden Tests
Hidden grading tests are **not** in this repository.

## Submission
- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
- Work in your fork (branch or `main` is fine).
- When ready to submit, tag the exact commit you want graded:
  ```bash
  git tag hw01-submit
  git push origin hw01-submit
  ```
- The `hw01-submit` tag is the official submission we grade.
